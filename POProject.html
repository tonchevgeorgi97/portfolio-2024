              Within the dynamic landscape of procure-to-pay solutions, purchase orders stand as a crucial element. At
              Payhawk, we&#39;ve long empowered our customers with comprehensive tools to process and pay invoices, as
              well as the ability to manage suppliers. However, recognising the pivotal role of purchase orders, we
              embarked on a journey to enhance our platform. By incorporating a purchase order system, we were aiming
              at extending the capabilities of our platform to provide control over the entire procure-to-pay process
              like no other competitor at that time did.

              Our product lacks a Purchase order system, which creates compliance issues for our clients and reduces
              the level of automation we provide. This ultimately decreases the value of our service to our users.

            <p class="body-text-5 dmsans-normal-celeste-18px">
              We addressed this problem by designing and implementing a comprehensive PO system. Our solution enables
              seamless PO creation through customizable workflows and PO document generation using a template.
              Crucially, It secures accuracy by executing the essential three-way matching process, aligning the
              invoice amount with the PO amount and verifying the ordered quantity against the goods received.

            <p class="body-text-5 dmsans-normal-celeste-18px">
              To tackle the design challenge, I started my discovery journey by conducting an extensive desk research.
              This initial phase was crucial in cultivating a deep understanding of the procure-to-pay
              process.<br /><br />Following
              the desk research, I undertook a comprehensive competitive analysis to gain insights into how other
              solutions were addressing similar needs. This analysis provided valuable benchmarks and highlighted
              potential opportunities for innovation within our own product.<br /><br />Upon further exploration,
              integrating a purchase order system revealed itself as a complex task, affecting multiple product areas
              significantly. Understanding the scale of this challenge and its potential impact on our product&#39;s
              core functionality, I opted for a structured approach to navigate the challenge effectively. I proposed
              facilitating a Google Design Sprint—an intensive, collaborative workshop that would enable us to rapidly
              iterate through ideas, validate assumptions, and align stakeholders towards a shared
              vision.<br /><br />The
              Google Design Sprint consisted of 5 phases that we distributed in 5 working days each of them with the
              following agenda:<br /><br />Day 1 - Understand: Problem definition, Goal, Target<br />Day 2 - Sketch:
              Ideation, critical thinking solution space<br />Day 3 - Decide: Narrow down solutions and storyboard
              building<br />Day 4 - Prototype: High fidelity prototype of the solution<br />Day 5 - Test: Collect
              feedback &amp; reactions

              After finishing the design workshop all stakeholders were aligned towards the vision for the needed
              solution and we managed to gather valuable insights on the user’s intentions and expectations for the
              desired product feature. We managed to test a high fidelity prototype with potential users and gather
              meaningful feedback on the way we can improve our experience. We found out what are the must have
              functionalities of a purchase order system suitable for our client’s use cases and helped us nail down
              our MVP that was going to enable us to compete with the best solutions in the procure to pay
              space.<br /><br />The
              prototyped solution went through a few more iterations, was validated by dozens of clients and was
              examined and challenged multiple times within the product, marketing and engineering
              teams.<br /><br />Today,
              the result stands as a fully functional solution, built upon the foundation of these collaborative
              efforts and user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and expectations of its intended
              audience.

        <p class="body-text-6 dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
          Within the dynamic landscape of procure-to-pay solutions, purchase orders stand as a crucial element. At
          Payhawk, we&#39;ve long empowered our customers with comprehensive tools to process and pay invoices, as
          well as the ability to manage suppliers. However, recognising the pivotal role of purchase orders, we
          embarked on a journey to enhance our platform. By incorporating a purchase order system, we were aiming at
          extending the capabilities of our platform to provide control over the entire procure-to-pay process like no
          other competitor at that time did.

        <div class="subtitle dmsans-bold-white-18px">The Problem Space</div>
        <p class="body-text-6 dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
          Our product lacks a Purchase order system, which creates compliance issues for our clients and reduces the
          level of automation we provide. This ultimately decreases the value of our service to our users.

        <div class="subtitle dmsans-bold-white-18px">The Solution</div>
        <p class="body-text-6 dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
          We addressed this problem by designing and implementing a comprehensive PO system. Our solution enables
          seamless PO creation through customizable workflows and PO document generation using a template. Crucially,
          It secures accuracy by executing the essential three-way matching process, aligning the invoice amount with
          the PO amount and verifying the ordered quantity against the goods received.

        <div class="subtitle dmsans-bold-white-18px">The Process</div>
        <p class="body-text-6 dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
          To tackle the design challenge, I started my discovery journey by conducting an extensive desk research.
          This initial phase was crucial in cultivating a deep understanding of the procure-to-pay
          process.<br /><br />Following
          the desk research, I undertook a comprehensive competitive analysis to gain insights into how other
          solutions were addressing similar needs. This analysis provided valuable benchmarks and highlighted
          potential opportunities for innovation within our own product.<br /><br />Upon further exploration,
          integrating a purchase order system revealed itself as a complex task, affecting multiple product areas
          significantly. Understanding the scale of this challenge and its potential impact on our product&#39;s core
          functionality, I opted for a structured approach to navigate the challenge effectively. I proposed
          facilitating a Google Design Sprint—an intensive, collaborative workshop that would enable us to rapidly
          iterate through ideas, validate assumptions, and align stakeholders towards a shared vision.<br /><br />The
          Google Design Sprint consisted of 5 phases that we distributed in 5 working days each of them with the
          following agenda:<br /><br />Day 1 - Understand: Problem definition, Goal, Target<br />Day 2 - Sketch:
          Ideation, critical thinking solution space<br />Day 3 - Decide: Narrow down solutions and storyboard
          building<br />Day 4 - Prototype: High fidelity prototype of the solution<br />Day 5 - Test: Collect feedback
          &amp; reactions

        <p class="body-text-6 dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
          After finishing the design workshop all stakeholders were aligned towards the vision for the needed solution
          and we managed to gather valuable insights on the user’s intentions and expectations for the desired product
          feature. We managed to test a high fidelity prototype with potential users and gather meaningful feedback on
          the way we can improve our experience. We found out what are the must have functionalities of a purchase
          order system suitable for our client’s use cases and helped us nail down our MVP that was going to enable us
          to compete with the best solutions in the procure to pay space.<br /><br />The prototyped solution went
          through a few more iterations, was validated by dozens of clients and was examined and challenged multiple
          times within the product, marketing and engineering teams.<br /><br />Today, the result stands as a fully
          functional solution, built upon the foundation of these collaborative efforts and user feedback, ensuring
          that it effectively meets the needs and expectations of its intended audience.
