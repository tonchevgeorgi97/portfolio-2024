                The payment gateway is a major revenue stream for Paysafe. It is operating in many countries around the
                world and facing millions of users. As a designer responsible for the product I put long hours into
                developing and maintaining a seamless and efficient payment experience. I have been involved in many
                gateway initiatives and projects ranging from a general redesign to integrating a crypto payment option
                and major KYC flow changes.

                It is rather difficult to generalize and point out one major design challenge for the payment gateway,

                focus on sport betting and gambling has always been a leading goal for every project initiative.

                There are many different persona types, but the most important one for the product driving most of the
                revenue has always been the sport bettor and gambler. Usually these are young 20 - 40 yo users who are
                sport fans and bet between 2â€“5 times a week. Their main needs are having secure payment options with
                high limits and minimizing the time &amp; cost it takes to deposit &amp; withdraw funds to/from betting
                operators,

                  wanted to attract more users and perform better in the time to task completion success rate metrics.
                  For the redesign I focused on optimizing the dashboard with the available payment methods, proper
                  error mapping and better overall feedback to the user, which turned out to be areas of bad
                  performance. After extensive research including qualitative and quantitative methods and tools. Major
                  usability issue was the lack of clarity and visibility of payment options. They needed to be presented
                  in a clear and self-explanatory way to the user, minimizing the friction and number of click to
                  completing a payment. For the new design I had to stick to the existing design system components
                  except for a couple of area special components. The redesigned Gateway was successfully launched first
                  for the US market and then for the rest of the world. Since then I am constantly monitoring the
                  product&#39;s performance and finding rooms for improvement of the experience.

                  base and deliver a more desired experience for our US users, me and my fellow colleagues created a
                  special one-of-a-kind flow that requires no KYC during registration and enables payments of up to 1000
                  USD without additional verification. In addition to that we developed a special VIP club program that
                  enables us to attract the top gamblers out there.

                The US iGaming gateway initiative has always been a major one for me since Skrill is massively entering
                the US gambling market in the past year and a half. In order to rapidly increase our user base and
                deliver a more desired experience for our US users, me and my fellow colleagues created a special
                one-of-a-kind flow that requires no KYC during registration and enables payments of up to 1000 USD
                without additional verification. In addition to that we developed a special VIP club program that
                enables us to attract the top gamblers out there.

            The payment gateway is a major revenue stream for Paysafe. It is operating in many countries around the
            world and facing millions of users. As a designer responsible for the product I put long hours into
            developing and maintaining a seamless and efficient payment experience. I have been involved in many gateway
            initiatives and projects ranging from a general redesign to integrating a crypto payment option and major
            KYC flow changes.

          <p class="body-text dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
            It is rather difficult to generalize and point out one major design challenge for the payment gateway, but
            it would be fair to say that creating an easy, secure and efficient payment experience with special focus on
            sport betting and gambling has always been a leading goal for every project initiative.

          <p class="body-text dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
            Same as for the design challenge, the target user for the payment gateway could not be generalized. There
            are many different persona types, but the most important one for the product driving most of the revenue has
            always been the sport bettor and gambler. Usually these are young 20 - 40 yo users who are sport fans and
            bet between 2â€“5 times a week. Their main needs are having secure payment options with high limits and
            minimizing the time &amp; cost it takes to deposit &amp; withdraw funds to/from betting operators,

            I was the only designer in the company merchant stream and have worked with many dev, product and marketing
            teams and a big amount of internal and external stakeholders. Most of the time I usually worked with 3 dev
            pods of around 4 members, but for some bigger initiatives I have been the go-to designer for up to 6 dev
            pods.

              One of the major projects that I have worked on is the redesign of the payment gateway. The old gateway
              design did a good service, but it was already too outdated and needed a fresh rework if we wanted to
              attract more users and perform better in the time to task completion success rate metrics. For the
              redesign I focused on optimizing the dashboard with the available payment methods, proper error mapping
              and better overall feedback to the user, which turned out to be areas of bad performance. After extensive
              research including qualitative and quantitative methods and tools. Major usability issue was the lack of
              clarity and visibility of payment options. They needed to be presented in a clear and self-explanatory way
              to the user, minimizing the friction and number of click to completing a payment. For the new design I had
              to stick to the existing design system components except for a couple of area special components. The
              redesigned Gateway was successfully launched first for the US market and then for the rest of the world.
              Since then I am constantly monitoring the product&#39;s performance and finding rooms for improvement of
              the experience.

              Having a new payment option on a worldwide used gateway is not a big deal, but when it is one of the first
              available crypto payment options out there it could be called an achievement. I am proud to say that I
              worked on special user flow that enables Skrill users to pay with their wallet available crypto balance.
