            <p class="following-the-succes dmsans-normal-celeste-18px">
              Following the successful launch of its crypto exchange, the Skrill digital wallet witnessed significant
              success and a rapid expansion of its user base. Recognising the potential for further growth and
              profitability, Skrill aimed to enhance its crypto exchange by introducing new functionalities and reward
              mechanisms tailored to the evolving needs of its freshly joined users. In the dynamic landscape of
              cryptocurrency, the concept of staking has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for investors to actively
              participate in blockchain networks while earning rewards. This is why crypto staking was undoubtedly the
              next big feature on the Skrill’s crypto exchange roadmap.

              As the Product Designer, I collaborated closely with a couple of Product managers, Product marketing
              manager, one pod of 7 Software engineers and a few other Directors of engineering from different product
              areas. The duration of the project was around 2 quarters (Q4 and Q1) from discovery to launch.

              For discovering this feature I was lucky to be able to be advised by a fellow UX researcher, who
              supported me in my preparation for facilitating my research activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;I used the following
              main research methods:<br /><br />User Surveys: Conducted surveys to gauge user interest in
              cryptocurrency staking and understand their preferences and pain points.<br />User Interviews:
              Interviewed a diverse group of Skrill users to gather insights into their knowledge and expectations
              regarding crypto staking<br />Competitor Analysis: Studied existing crypto staking platforms to identify
              best practices and areas for improvement.<br /><br />In the following paragraphs, I aim to provide a
              summary of the research findings that significantly influenced the development of the final UX solution.

              offering a wide array of different cryptocurrencies for staking within our MVP. We were constrained to
              just a couple of cryptocurrencies available on the Crypto.com exchange. Furthermore we were going to be
              limited to the provider’s APY yields and staking periods. This was an unconvinient challenge, but also
              gave us a clear framework for operating further.

        <p class="body-text dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
          Following the successful launch of its crypto exchange, the Skrill digital wallet witnessed significant
          success and a rapid expansion of its user base. Recognising the potential for further growth and
          profitability, Skrill aimed to enhance its crypto exchange by introducing new functionalities and reward
          mechanisms tailored to the evolving needs of its freshly joined users. In the dynamic landscape of
          cryptocurrency, the concept of staking has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for investors to actively
          participate in blockchain networks while earning rewards. This is why crypto staking was undoubtedly the
          next big feature on the Skrill’s crypto exchange roadmap.

        <p class="body-text dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
          As the Product Designer, I collaborated closely with a couple of Product managers, Product marketing
          manager, one pod of 7 Software engineers and a few other Directors of engineering from different product
          areas. The duration of the project was around 2 quarters (Q4 and Q1) from discovery to launch.

          For discovering this feature I was lucky to be able to be advised by a fellow UX researcher, who supported
          me in my preparation for facilitating my research activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;I used the following main research
          methods:<br /><br />User Surveys: Conducted surveys to gauge user interest in cryptocurrency staking and
          understand their preferences and pain points.<br />User Interviews: Interviewed a diverse group of Skrill
          users to gather insights into their knowledge and expectations regarding crypto staking<br />Competitor
          Analysis: Studied existing crypto staking platforms to identify best practices and areas for
          improvement.<br /><br />In
          the following paragraphs, I aim to provide a summary of the research findings that significantly influenced
          the development of the final UX solution.

          that emerged as the focal point for the staking feature. Through these interviews and data analysis, I
          synthesized insights into the behaviours, needs, and pain points of the vital Skrill users engaging with

            During the discovery we encountered a significant business constraint coming&nbsp;&nbsp;from our

            offering a wide array of different cryptocurrencies for staking within our MVP. We were constrained to
            just a couple of cryptocurrencies available on the Crypto.com exchange. Furthermore we were going to be
            limited to the provider’s APY yields and staking periods. This was an unconvinient challenge, but also
            gave us a clear framework for operating further.

        <p class="body-text dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
          Following the successful launch of its crypto exchange, the Skrill digital wallet witnessed significant
          success and a rapid expansion of its user base. Recognising the potential for further growth and
          profitability, Skrill aimed to enhance its crypto exchange by introducing new functionalities and reward
          mechanisms tailored to the evolving needs of its freshly joined users. In the dynamic landscape of
          cryptocurrency, the concept of staking has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for investors to actively
          participate in blockchain networks while earning rewards. This is why crypto staking was undoubtedly the
          next big feature on the Skrill’s crypto exchange roadmap.

        <p class="body-text dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
          As the Product Designer, I collaborated closely with a couple of Product managers, Product marketing
          manager, one pod of 7 Software engineers and a few other Directors of engineering from different product
          areas. The duration of the project was around 2 quarters (Q4 and Q1) from discovery to launch.

          For discovering this feature I was lucky to be able to be advised by a fellow UX researcher, who supported
          me in my preparation for facilitating my research activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;I used the following main research
          methods:<br /><br />User Surveys: Conducted surveys to gauge user interest in cryptocurrency staking and
          understand their preferences and pain points.<br />User Interviews: Interviewed a diverse group of Skrill
          users to gather insights into their knowledge and expectations regarding crypto staking<br />Competitor
          Analysis: Studied existing crypto staking platforms to identify best practices and areas for
          improvement.<br /><br />In
          the following paragraphs, I aim to provide a summary of the research findings that significantly influenced
          the development of the final UX solution.

          After conducting a couple of in-depth user interviews and analyzing existing data on Skrill&#39;s
          user&nbsp;&nbsp;profile base from various markets around the world, I identified two primary persona types
          that emerged as the focal point for the staking feature. Through these interviews and data analysis, I
          synthesized insights into the behaviours, needs, and pain points of the vital Skrill users engaging with
          crypto assets and created the following personas:

          During the discovery we encountered a significant business constraint coming&nbsp;&nbsp;from our partnership
          with Crypto.com as our service provider. Due to this collaboration, we faced limitations in offering a wide
          array of different cryptocurrencies for staking within our MVP. We were constrained to just a couple of
          cryptocurrencies available on the Crypto.com exchange. Furthermore we were going to be limited to the
          provider’s APY yields and staking periods. This was an unconvinient challenge, but also gave us a clear
          framework for operating further.
