                  The Sports Corner was the newest and most significant feature of the Skrill wallet. It gives various
                  sport related winning tips, head-to-head statistics, live score, player and the latest news. It was an
                  important initiative that helped Skrill get closer to its ultimate goal to become the best e-wallet

            The Sports Corner was the newest and most significant feature of the Skrill wallet. It gives various sport
            related winning tips, head-to-head statistics, live score, player and the latest news. It was an important
            initiative that helped Skrill get closer to its ultimate goal to become the best e-wallet for gambling
            worldwide. The launch of the sports corner and its positive feedback gave birth to project for a new wallet
            app onboarding and a personalized dashboard for sports bettors. The redesigned Skrill MVP version was
            initially launched on the Portuguese market where primary user feedback was gathered through a large scale
            A/B test.

            The target persona for this project is the so-called Sport ritualist. This is a young 20 - 40 y.o. male who
            is a huge sports fan and bet between 2 to 5 times a week. His main goals are to make informed and
            well-thought bets, have control over his betting funds and feel informed about what is happening in the
            football domain. His needs are to minimize the time &amp; cost it takes to deposit &amp; withdraw funds
            to/from betting operators, decrease the time to learn the most important facts &amp; developments about
            football and minimize the time it takes to gather the necessary statistics for selected games.

              The design team I was part of tacked this project by conducting extensive desk research. We carried out a
              series of interviews to develop detailed user archetypes, gaining deep insights into our target audience.
              Additionally, we thoroughly analyzed our competitors&#39; products and digital experiences. Drawing from
              our research, we crafted empathy and journey maps, enabling us to define precise job statements and pose
              critical HMW questions.

              Sitting on an extensive research data we continued our design process by ideating on different low &amp;

              put time and iterated on them until we reached the most suitable user-centered design solution.

          <p class="body-text dmsans-normal-celeste-16px">
            We created a new Skrill onboarding experience that gathers important data about the personal preferences of
            the user regarding sports and the financial services that we offer. After a successful registration the user
            lands on a personalized dashboard with emphasis on upcoming games and statistics. There is information on
            where and how he can spend with Skrill and what additional financial services we can offer. The user is also
            provided with additional navigation and explanation of the remaining required steps for him until he is
            fully onboarded. During this initiative I also explored additional concepts for services that could add
            value and drive extra revenue such as Sports travelling offers.
